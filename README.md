## Overview :

*  IIITMG Club Management Web Application aims to create a platform for IIITMG students which will enable them to resume the activities of the clubs (such as Manchtantra, Uthaan etc) which have stopped due to the pandemic. 
*  After signing into the website by using IIITMG mail id, a student will be allotted a
unique id. He/she has to fill up a form which will ask for his/her personal
information such as information about the clubs which he/she has joined and the
clubs for which he/she has applied. After applying for a particular club the student
can be selected/rejected by the club head which will be notified via email to the
student. 
* Club heads can control the website according to the club that they have
been allocated. Also one can view all the recent activities of any club and its
members. 
* In order to incorporate all the above functionalities in the web application, we have used
front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and back-end
technologies such as NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB.
